## ZUGFeRD

[ZUGFeRD](http://www.ferd-net.de/front_content.php?idcat=255&lang=4) is a open european PDF invoice metadata standard. ZUGFeRD invoices look like ordinary PDFs but they contain a XML file with amounts, taxes, due dates, sender and recipient and can e.g. be parsed and paid automatically.

### This page

ZUGFeRD.org is the open source incubator and communication hub for and around ZUGFeRD.
Specifically for the people around ZUGFeRD there is the [ZUGFeRD-community](ZUGFeRD-community), which even has a forum. Unfortunately for open source developers the human language is very german there :-(
We do therefore employ our own, english [Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zugferd). 

### Projects

* The [Corpus](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/corpus) is a collection of real, sample and test ZUGFeRD invoices, some with artificial errors. They serve as test cases for readers and validators. Contribute by adding samples and (privacy-not-infringing) real live examples of your ZUGFeRD implementation!
* There is a [Plugin](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/hibiscus) plugin for the open source online banking software [Hibiscus](https://www.willuhn.de/products/hibiscus/) which was a proof-of-concept for the [ZUGFeRD developer days](http://www.zugferd-entwicklertage.de) 2016 
* We're trying to find out if and how we can contribute a ZUGFeRD plugin to the great [VeraPDF](www.verapdf.org) PDF validator in the [ZUV](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/ZUV) ZUgferd+Verapdf project
* Additionally, we are evaluating if and how the [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) standard can potentially be used as a protocol layer for ZUGFeRD invoices

Projects like [Konik](http://konik.io) and [Mustang](http://www.mustangproject.org/) are either already too big or simply started before this initiative. If you know other open source projects please [let us know](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zugferd). Kudos go to great PDF related open source projects like Apache [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/), [itext](https://github.com/itext) and of course [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/).
