## ZUGFeRD

[ZUGFeRD](http://www.ferd-net.de/front_content.php?idcat=255&lang=4) and Factur-X is a open european PDF invoice metadata standard. ZUGFeRD invoices embed a XML structure into PDF and look and behave like ordinary PDFs but can also be parsed and paid automatically. ZUGFeRD version 2 is supposed to match Factur-X version 1.

### This page

ZUGFeRD.org is the incubator and communication hub for and around ZUGFeRD open source *projects*. Others may also be [around](open-source.md). 
Our [repos](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD).
For *people* and commercial projects around ZUGFeRD there is the [ZUGFeRD-community](http://www.zugferd-community.net), which even has a forum. Unfortunately for open source developers the human language is very german there :-(
We do therefore employ our own, english [Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zugferd). 

### Projects

* There is a curated list of ZUGFeRD/Factur-X [Open-Source](open-source.md) projects.  If you know other open source projects please [let us know](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zugferd). Some repos also live here:


* The [Corpus](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/corpus) is a collection of real, sample and test ZUGFeRD invoices, some with artificial errors. They serve as test cases for readers and validators. Contribute by adding samples and (privacy-not-infringing) real live examples of your ZUGFeRD implementation!
* There is a [Plugin](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/hibiscus) plugin for the open source online banking software [Hibiscus](https://www.willuhn.de/products/hibiscus/) which was a proof-of-concept for the [ZUGFeRD developer days](http://www.zugferd-entwicklertage.de) 2016 
* We're trying to find out if and how we can contribute a ZUGFeRD plugin to the great [VeraPDF](www.verapdf.org) PDF validator in the [ZUV](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/ZUV) ZUgferd+Verapdf project
* Additionally, with [ZOX](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/ZOX) we are evaluating if and how the [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) standard can potentially be used as a protocol layer for ZUGFeRD invoices

* the [Mustang](http://www.mustangproject.org/) source code repository [is here](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/mustangproject)
