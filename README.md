## ZUGFeRD

[ZUGFeRD](http://www.ferd-net.de/front_content.php?idcat=255&lang=4) / Factur-X is a open european PDF invoice metadata standard. ZUGFeRD invoices embed a XML structure into PDF and look and behave like ordinary PDFs but can also be parsed and paid automatically. ZUGFeRD version 2 matches Factur-X version 1.

### This page

ZUGFeRD.org is the incubator and communication hub for and around ZUGFeRD open source *projects*. Others may also be [around](open-source.md). 
Our [repos](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD).
For *people* and commercial projects around ZUGFeRD there is the [ZUGFeRD-community](http://www.zugferd-community.net), which even has a forum. Unfortunately for open source developers the human language is very german there :-(
We do therefore employ our own, english [Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zugferd). 

### Projects

* There is a curated list of ZUGFeRD/Factur-X [Open-Source](open-source.md) projects.  If you know other open source projects please [let us know](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zugferd). Some repos also live here:


* The [Corpus](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/corpus) is a collection of real, sample and test ZUGFeRD invoices, some with artificial errors. They serve as test cases for readers and validators. Contribute by adding samples and (privacy-not-infringing) real live examples of your ZUGFeRD implementation!
