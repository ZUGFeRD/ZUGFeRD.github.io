=== How do I know it's ZUGFeRD/Factur-X/how many do I already have/what is the market share?
ZUGFeRD/Factur-X are ordinary PDF files, some readers may signal e.g. with a disclaimer on a blue background that
it's a PDF/A file, which may be a hint, but the "smoking gun" is a embedded .XML file like
factur-x.xml, ZUGFeRD-invoice.xml, zugferd-invoice.xml or xrechnung.xml.
Embedded files may be shown as "paperclip" symbol, unfortunately some PDF readers like
web browsers don't support embedded files.

If you want to check a local directory structure you can e.g. use the open source
link:https://www.mustangproject.org/kommandozeile/?lang=de#count[Mustangproject]
commandline "metrics" feature. Unfortunately, to this day no study is known to elaborate
on the market share of ZUGFeRD/Factur-X invoices, i.e. which percentage of PDF invoices
on average contain ZUGFeRD/Factur-X data.

=== Which formats are eligible? Why only them?

For B2G and B2B both EN16931-2 XML formats, UBL and CII, are eligible,
for B2B you can additionally use CII based ZUGFeRD/Factur-X.

Why UBL and CII is explained in EN16931-2, https://www.beuth.de/de/technische-regel/din-cen-ts-16931-2/274991011
why CII developed in the first place after UBL is explained on https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/57887/UBL%20and%20CEFACT%20update%20-%2020160407.pdf
and that Factur-X is allowed has been laid down in https://www.dstv.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BMF_2023-0922192-R.pdf


=== Can I just convert from one XML format to the other?
Theoretically yes, but there is currently only one open source Java
link:https://github.com/phax/en16931-cii2ubl[library] which only converts in only one direction, from CII to UBL


=== How can I check if a file is valid
[#validators]
There are validators which will check for syntax and algorithmic correctness, apart from
proprietary also some open-sourced

* The link:https://www.zugferd-community.net/de/open_community/validation[ZUGFeRD community] uses the link:https://mustangproject.org[Mustang] engine
* link:https://services.fnfe-mpe.org/[FNFE] uses a link:https://github.com/akretion/factur-x-validator[odoo based engine] and
* link:https://ecosio.com/de/peppol-und-xml-dokumente-online-validieren/[Ecosio] (XML only) uses link:https://github.com/phax/phive[PHIVE] as an engine

For semantic correctness you may want to refer to a link:index.adoc#_display[viewer]

=== Who chooses which format is used
The sender


=== What do I have to consider when sending/receiving electronic invoices

In germany, in one word: GoBD.
There are
Principles for the proper keeping and storage of books,records and documents in electronic form and for data access

=== How can I automatically submit german B2G invoices

Kosit, the authority for government invoices, so to speak, has joined the
EDI network Peppol and discontinued the existing API access to the ZRE.

This means that the only way to submit government invoices in
Germany is completely automated is via Peppol. You
not only still have to address the Peppol invoice to the correct portal
to the correct portal, you also have to register with each portal beforehand
(at least automated) beforehand.

=== XRechnung Referenzprofil CII

XRechnung is defined for UBL and UN/CEFACT, but ZUGFeRD itself in the
XRechnung reference profile is exclusively a UN/CEFACT format. In the
review, the corresponding mention (section 3.2.4 on p. 13) was considered sufficient.
was considered sufficient.


=== Which version of which standard do I have to use?
<a href="https://www.beuth.de/de/technische-regel/din-cen-ts-16931-2/274991011">EN16931-2</a> mentions "2016b" of <a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/xml-schemas">Cross Industry Invoice</a> CII or UBL 2.1,
ZUGFeRD 2.x (2.3.1 is the newest) and <a href="https://xeinkauf.de/xrechnung/">XRechnung</a> 3.0.1 (updates once a year) are compliant to the new B2B rules. Please note
that ZUGFeRD 2.x equals Factur-X 1.x. ZUGFeRD version 1 has never been officially deprecated but is likely to be
discontinued and it's not compliant to EN16931, so neither usable for B2G invoices nor for B2B invoices in the future.


=== ZUGFeRD/Factur-X: XML or PDF: What do I have to use, check, respectively archive how?

In Germany, if you are a company, you will have to check and use XML (source https://www.dstv.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BMF_2023-0922192-R.pdf) and archive also at least XML (GoBD page 30, §9.1 Maschinelle Auswertbarkeit).
As customer, you can decide if you check&use XML or PDF. However, and despite the spec says the contents should be identical, due to possible fraud please do not check e.g. only the PDF and then pay the XML version. Unfortunately, if you wanted to auto detect deviations you need OCR and a invoice recognition and your results will most likely not be perfect.
Hoewever, if you receive by email, unless there is any invoice related information in the email text (like "as agreed on the phone just pay half of it") you usually have no obligation to archive the email.

=== Europa/ViDA

With the EU draft directive link:https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/topnews/M-009199[Vat in the Digital Age (ViDA)]
 is being worked on,
at least as far as cross-border transactions are concerned.

And ViDA wants to build on the B2G e-invoicing standard EN16931.

== Background

=== When I receive a Factur-X, can I book automatically?

Usually not. E.g. using link:#validators[validators] you may be able to confirm the invoice is calculated
correctly but you can only book automatically (german: Dunkelbuchung) in ideal circumstances: e.g. if you already
entered the order in your system and you have confirmation about the incoming goods in your system and the invoice
refers to the order you will be able to confirm that the invoice also __matches__ your order. Together with
whitelisted bank details in this case you can probably pay and book automatically.

=== What does the ZUGFeRD abbreviation stand for?

ZUGFeRD was once called Central User Guide Forum Electronic Invoice
Germany (Zentraler User Guide Forum elektronische Rechnung Deutschland). The ``ZUG'' in the name was possibly a tribute to the
MUG, the Message User Group, which developed CWA and thus defined
which subset of CII, for example, is important for European use: VAT, for example
is important for European use: VAT, for example, yes, North American sales tax, for example, no. The
international name became Factur-X. For historical reasons
Factur-X 1 was released when ZUGFeRD had just reached version 2, ZUGFeRD 2
therefore corresponds to Factur-X 1.

After Order-X and after the start but before the completion of the work (on
delivery bills, called Deliver-X), ZUGFeRD became a format family: the term
The term changed to the plural, link:https://www.ferd-net.de/aktuelles/meldungen/rueckblick-auf-die-sitzung-des-ferd-plenums.html[Zentrale User Guides Forum
elektronische Rechnung Deutschland], the abbreviation remained.




=== Netto

§6.4.3.1.1

=== Credit Note

real commercial credit note: any non-380 type code, no
minus BUT cancellation invoice (and that's what 90% mean by credit note):
negative quantity->negative price, negative VAT so practically everything
Minus. Typecode for cancellation invoice I mean 384, there is an
official ZUGFeRD example.




=== Decimals

link:https://www.beuth.de/en/standard/din-en-16931-1/314992770[EN16931-1]
explains §6.5.12 that sums are rounded to two decimals,
the line total, tax amount, amount due.
The number of decimals for Prices and Quantity is defined in ISO15000 appendix B "Amount" type.

A colleague mentioned "decimal" Chapter 3.2.3 at https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/ to be significant, which seems to be a
18-digit number, not neccessarily a floating point number.
Floating point numbers could introduce other issues like with

=== Order-X

Public review 1
https://www.ferd-net.de/aktuelles/meldungen/public-review-des-entwurfs-fuer-order-x-hat-begonnen-und-laeuft-bis-ende-september-2020.html


=== What OpenSource tools/libraries exist?

I have tried to list all source solutions on link:index.adoc[this page]

=== How to write ZUGFeRD

=== How can I distinguish ZF1 from ZF2=FX1?

The name of the embedded file is ZUGFeRD-invoice.xml for ZF1 and zugferd-invoice.xml, factur-x.xml or xrechnung.xml for ZF2. And the root element is CrossIndustryDocument for ZF1 and CrossIndustryInvoice for ZF2.


==== Requirements


=== What is the content-difference between ZUGFeRD/Factur-X and XRechnung

ZUGFeRD/Factur-X is always CII while XRechnung can be UBL or CII.
Content-wise the XRechnung asks for

* a Leitweg-ID as buyer reference (a kind of recipient ID issues by the german authorities)
* bank transfer as payment method
* a contact with phone number and email from the sender of the invoice
* a means of electronically reaching sender and recipient (e.g. E-mail)
* EN16931 explicitly disallows cash discount (Skonto) in it's XML, so the XRechnung specifies a proprietary format to re-introduce structured information in what otherwise would be a freetext field



=== Where do I get schema files/further info

Schema, Schematron, Samples, Spec, Reference and Codelists are available
via the ZF Infopaket https://www.ferd-net.de/ZUGFeRD-Download

The possible Attribute values are shared between UBL and CII, 18 of ~20 lists are also separately available in link:https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/Registry+of+supporting+artefacts+to+implement+EN16931[version 12 here].



The calculation of electronic invoices is standardized within the framework of link:https://www.beuth.de/en/standard/din-en-16931-1/314992770[EN16931-1] which can be obtained free of charge online, in Germany in the shop of the
store of the DIN-affiliated Beuth publishing house.



As far as I know, quantities and prices may have four digits (see theFactur-X specification 1.0.50, section 7.1.5), the item must be rounded to two-digit sums
be rounded to two-digit totals - and the sum of the items with the sameitems with the same VAT rate leads to the two-digit VAT amount for this rate.VAT amount for this rate. See also EN16931-1 chapter 6.5.12,
where, interestingly, net prices are quoted in two digits.


=== How do collective invoices work in Factur-X Extended?
It's about the item attributes

----
<ram:BuyerOrderReferencedDocument>
  <ram:IssuerAssignedID>ORDER84359</ram:IssuerAssignedID>
  <ram:LineID>1</ram:LineID>
</ram:BuyerOrderReferencedDocument>
----

IssuerAssignedID, i.e. the order, is only available *on item level* in extended, i.e. different items can refer to different orders.
The official example is EXTENDED_InnergemeinschLieferungMehrereBestellungen.pdf from the ZUGFeRD Infopaket.

=== What is the difference between Factur-X and ZUGFeRD

Factur-X 1.0.50 is the French and international name of ZUGFeRD2.1 The Factur-X file name (factur-x.xml) and metadata (RDF metadatawith the namespace prefix "fx") are preferred since ZUGFeRD 2.1.


=== What is the difference between PDF and PDF/A

ZUGFeRD/Factur-X is based on PDF/A is a subset of PDF.
While the PDF spec is freely available PDF/A
is defined in ISO 19000-5, it is

* archivable, and a such
* self contained and
* validatable

compared to PDF.
Self contained e.g. means it lacks the feature of referencing external fonts, i.e. all fonts have to be embedded in the document.


In contrast to ordinary PDF, there are only two clearly defined ways to
embed and hence extract embedded files (flat and tree).

There are PDF/A validators like the open-source link:https://verapdf.org[Verapdf].

An especially wild example of usual non-PDF/A-PDF is link:https://pocorgtfo.hacke.rs/pocorgtfo16.pdf[Proof of concept or get the fuck out of here 0x16] which is "valid" "as a PDF document, a ZIP archive, and a Bash script that runs a Python webserver which hosts Kaitai Struct’s WebIDE which, allowing you to view the file’s own annotated bytes".

=== Where can I ask questions?

Apart from Stackoverflow there is

* The link:https://groups.google.com/g/zugferd[google group]  in english
* The link:https://www.zugferd-community.net/de/open_community/forum[ZUGFeRD community forum]  in german and a
* Matrix  link:https://app.element.io/#/room/#facturx:matrix.org[chatroom]  in english
